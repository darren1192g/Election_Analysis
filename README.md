  ## Future uses

### The Python code given here can be adapted for any future needs for any vote casting audits. This program is allowed to grow to match any size data given. You can break down which county votes for each candidate was and see the candidate that was the most popular in that county.  Now think about this, say you would like to know who around you have the best cheeseburgers in town. You team up with a programmer and they write this amazing survey anyone can take and just post it to social media. Now you can take that data and adapt this code to tell you where you are going to try your next cheeseburger at, as you print out the top five list head out the door.
